describe the full context and solution without addressing specific users or directly answering anyone. Present the information formally, include relevant URLs, and don't set up a question-answer format or introduce Meilisearch. The summary is meant for a Meilisearch help center publication. When possible summarize the context in less than three paragraphs. You must not make it look like I show you a conversation.
